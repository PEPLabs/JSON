     * JSON - JavaScript Object Notation, is a common data interchange format. That means it is the basic way that
     * data regarding an Object is sent over the internet. JavaScript can interpret JSON as an Object natively, but
     * other languages have to parse JSON into an Object using their own means - so, this exercise will have you
     * deserialize JSON to an Object. In the future, you will use tools that can do this automatically, but for now,
     * use String manipulation.
     *
     * The exact type you will be deserializing will be the provided AnimalModel. It follows a standard JSON format,
     * of key-value pairs separated by commas, like this:
     *
     * {
     *     "name":"whiskers",
     *     "species":"cat",
     *     "age":4
     * }
     *
     * Please note that in JSON, Strings are encased by double quotes while primitive numbers/booleans are not,
     * and the final item does not have an ending comma.
     *
     * @param json
     * @return
